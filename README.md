# TechSavvy

This is the repo for TechSavvy, my senior capstone. TechSavvy is designed to help people gain tech skills, starting with Microsoft Word. 
It uses Python, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, Flask, and the OpenAi API.

# Installation

TechSavvy requires the following packages: You can use pip install

```bash
pip install Flask
pip install openai
pip venv
```

# API key

In the file.env file there is an empty space for your OpenAI API. Insert it there to ensure the project runs correctly after cloning

# Usage
